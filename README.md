## Personal goals for Chinese this semester reflection

I think I've achieved some of my goals for learning Chinese this semester, but there are still things I can work on as always. I have learned to recognize more characters and use more grammar structures. But my writing ability without reference is still limited as I rely too heavily on recognition and pinyin rather than learning the characters by heart. In terms of pronunciation for Chinese, I think I've gotten worse at distinguishing between h and no h sound in ch, sh, and zh sounds this semester compared to last semester. This is because I've moved out this semester to be able to attend class in person and don't have my parents' support in correcting my pronunciation. I also haven't really put in the time to practice this semester because my other courses have been quite demanding. So going forward, I need to put more time into practicing Chinese orally in terms of pronunciation and handwriting characters. 

## Plan to review/study Chinese during the summer

I don't have a formal plan as to how I'll review or study Chinese during the summer at the moment. I'll likely keep doing what I'm currently doing to learn and practice Chinese. This means using WeChat to stay in touch with my relatives and having conversations through text in Chinese because they don't know English. For July and August, I would try to get into a video call with my younger cousin who's in China to get her to teach me some more Chinese if she's not traveling. I know my mom would also try to get me to practice handwriting Chinese characters alongside my sister. And my grandma who's currently staying with my parents back in Richmond Hill would likely take the time to get me to read Chinese books to improve my Chinese recognition if I'm not too busy with summer courses. I usually go with the flow and find what works as things come because plans were never really my thing.
