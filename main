### Personal goals for Chinese this semester reflection

I think I've achieved some of my goals for learning Chinese this semester, but there are still things I can work on as always. I have learned to recognize more characters and use more grammar structures. But my writing ability without reference is still limited as I rely too heavily on recognition and pinyin rather than learning the characters by heart. In terms of pronunciation for Chinese, I think I've gotten worse at distinguishing between h and no h sound in ch, sh, and zh sounds this semester compared to last semester. This is because I've moved out this semester to be able to attend class in person and don't have my parents' support in correcting my pronunciation. I also haven't really put in the time to practice this semester because my other courses have been quite demanding. So going forward, I need to put more time into practicing Chinese orally in terms of pronunciation and handwriting characters.
